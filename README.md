### Build from Source
### Development

With dependencies installed, you can utilize the following npm scripts to manage your project's development lifecycle:

- `pnpm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot reloading enabled.
- `pnpm run preview`: Serves your build output locally for preview before deployment.
- `pnpm run build`: Bundles your site into static files for production.
